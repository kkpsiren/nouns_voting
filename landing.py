## Nouns Governance Participation
      
### Intro

The Nouns are an Ethereum NFT project that brings a unique minting mechanism to the NFT space. One Noun is auctioned trustlessly every 24 hours, forever. 100% of the proceeds from these auctions are sent to the DAO treasury, 
which as of the time of this writing sits at 27,416 ETH. Getting a Noun wonâ€™t be cheap, as recent auctions have closed at over 100 ETH. As a Noun token holder you are entitled to one vote in the DAO, which uses a fork of Compound Governance and controls the treasury. There are no rules about trait rarity, and the artwork is generative and stored on-chain. Once an auction ends, someone must settle the current auction to initiate a new auction, which will restart the minting / auction cycle.

For more details, see https://nouns.wtf/ & and its satellite https://lilnouns.wtf/.
This dashboard shows the on-chain voting for NounsDAO. Which proposals have had the most engagement, relative to the number of tokens minted?

## Methods
For this dashboard used the ShroomDK for querying the data from Flipside.  
Plotly and Pandas for the data viz and shamelessly took and modified the intro written by Flipside somewhere earlier (probably the layer3 bounty).
